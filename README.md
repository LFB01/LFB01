## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fee â€“ currently transitioning into software development after starting my career as a medical doctor.  
Driven by curiosity and a strong sense of responsibility, I love solving real-world problems â€“ especially when they help others.

I'm currently pursuing a **Masterâ€™s degree in Medical Informatics (M.Sc.)** and constantly expanding my coding skills through books, videos, courses â€“ and of course, GPT.  
Understanding how things work is what keeps me going.

Right now, I'm working on an MVP for a hospital **shift and workplace planning tool** â€“ a task my former colleagues often had to do manually in their limited spare time.
